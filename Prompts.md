**Example 1 -**

Consider yourself as a Senior DevOps Engineer.  
I want to build a **CI/CD Pipeline Health Dashboard** to monitor executions from GitHub Actions tools.

The dashboard should Display -  
• Show real-time metrics:  
  o Success/Failure rate  
  o Average build time  
  o Last build status  

• Send alerts Slack on pipeline failures.  

• Provide a simple frontend UI to:  
  o Visualize pipeline metrics  
  o Display status of latest builds  

• Collect data on pipeline executions (success/failure, build time, status).  

Dashboard should be built using the following Languages -  
  o Backend (Node.js)  
  o Frontend (React)  
  o Database (PostgreSQL)  

Note - Dockerize all the applications.
